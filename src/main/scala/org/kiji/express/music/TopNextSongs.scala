  // This Scalding pipeline does the following:
  // 1. Reads the column "info:track_plays" from a users table in Kiji.
  // 2. Transforms each user's play history into a collection of bigrams that record when
  //    one song was played after another.
  // 3. Counts the number of times each song was played after another.
  // 4. Creates a SongCount Avro specific record from each bigram.
  // 5. For each song S, creates a list of songs sorted by the number of times the song was
  //    played after S.
  // 6. Converts each list of SongCount records into an Avro-compatible java.util.List.
  // 7. Packs each list into an Avro record.
  // 8. Creates an entity id for the songs table for each song.
  // 9. Writes each song's TopSongs record to Kiji.
